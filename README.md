# WiFi Key Content Revealer
I made this script for my girlfriend specifically as she had problems getting access to the WiFi at home. With access to a machine that already had connected to the WiFi network, I knew that it would be stored on the machine, but as I knew she was not the best person at computers I made her a script to make it really easy for her.

## Script features
- Displays a list of known WiFi names (SSID).

## Storage features
- Store date when the key was fetched.
- Store WiFi name (SSID).
- Store the key content of a previously used WiFi network.
